# GeRedE: A Corpus of German Reddit Exchanges
GeRedE is a 270 million token German CMC corpus containing approximately 380,000 submissions and 6,800,000 comments posted on
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) between 2010 and 2018. Reddit is a popular online platform combining social news aggregation, discussion and micro-blogging. The CWB-indexed version of our final corpus is available to registered academic users via [CQPweb](https://corpora.linguistik.uni-erlangen.de/cqpweb/gerede_v1)

This repository contains the scripts we used to extract German submissions and comments from the vast amount of data Jason Baumgartner provides at https://files.pushshift.io/reddit. It also contains the IDs of all submissions and comments included in our corpus, so that those who wish to recreate our corpus are not required to run all processing steps by themselves.
